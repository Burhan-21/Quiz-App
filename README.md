# Online Quiz App

This console-based Quiz App, built with Java 17+, is designed to help you practice collections, control flow, and user-driven design. It showcases Java features like ArrayList, switch expressions, methods, and basic OOP to create a fun and flexible quiz platformâ€”with Admin features to add/delete questions.

## Features

- Take a multiple-choice quiz with randomized questions and instant feedback
- Preloaded with 10 questions (add or delete your own as Admin)
- Admin panel: add new questions with options, or remove undesired ones
- Real-time scoring and pass/fail calculation
- Input validation and beginner-friendly feedback
- Uses collections, switch-case menu logic, and object-oriented principles
- Simple menu-driven interface

## Code Structure

**QuizApp**  
- Contains the `main` method, user interface loop, and menu logic.

**Question**  
- Simple class representing a single quiz question (question, options, correct answer), with a method to check correctness.

**Admin Functions**  
- Add/Delete/View questions, all in-memory (no file persistence).

**Player Functions**  
- Attempts quiz using current questions, displays score and feedback.

## Modern Java Concepts Used

- **ArrayList:** Easy resizing and managing dynamic collections of questions.  
- **Switch-Case & Enhanced Switch:** Clear menu-driven program execution.  
- **For/While loops:** Control program flow for repeated actions (menus, quizzes).  
- **Encapsulation:** Data and related methods grouped in the `Question` class.  
- **Input validation:** Prevents common user-entry errors.

## What I Learned

- Using collections (`ArrayList`) for dynamic data management.  
- Writing modular and beginner-friendly console apps with reusable code.  
- Implementing role-based access (Admin/Player).  
- Adding input validation and clear error messages for robust apps.  
- Designing and documenting Java projects for self-learning and teaching.

## FAQ / Common Issues

- **Wrong input (letters when numbers expected):** The app asks you againâ€”no crash.  
- **Adding duplicate questions:** Allowed, but not recommended (questions are identified by order, not text).  
- **Deleting out-of-range questions:** Tells you if the number is invalid.  
- **Quiz looks the same each time:** Donâ€™t worry, questions are shuffled for fairness!

## Interview Cheat Sheet

- **How do you shuffle a list in Java?**  
  `Collections.shuffle(list);`

- **What are Collections in Java?**  
  Frameworks for storing/manipulating groups of objects (like `ArrayList`, `Map`).

- **Difference between switch-case and if-else?**  
  Switch is cleaner for many discrete cases; if-else is for ranges/complex logic.

- **How do you accept/validate console input in Java?**  
  Use `Scanner` to get input; check type with `hasNextInt()` etc.

- **How do you add/remove items from an ArrayList?**  
  `add(element)` to add, `remove(index)` to remove.
